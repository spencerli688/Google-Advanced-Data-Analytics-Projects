# GoogleAdvancedDACertProjects

Hello! Welcome to Spencer's Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate repository!
In this repository, I will place all the end of course projects in here for public views. 

This repository will be actively updating as I finish my courses in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

There are three project scenarios in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
- Automatidata
- Tiktok
- Waze

Through a Python scenario generator (scenariogenerator.py) file here, I ran a short Python code that would generate a number from 1 to 3. The code has an output of 1, so in this portfolio, I will be doing the Automatidata scenario. However, after I finish Automatidata and if time permits, I will update this portfolio to include the Tiktok and Waze scenarios. My goal is to finish at least the Automatidata scenario by June 2025. 

I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate one year prior to starting the Advanced certificate.
