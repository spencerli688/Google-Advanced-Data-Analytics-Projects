Well folks, this is it!

In this section, I will be showcasing my version of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project!

This is also the final milestone of the course before I get my certificate. 

The capstone project is titled: Providing data-driven suggestions for HR. 

The Sailfort Motors HR team has requested me to do a full data analytics project in this scenario. This will include:

- PLAN STAGE: Imports (Concepts from all 6 courses) and simple data exploration (Initial Data Exploration and Cleaning, concepts from Courses 2 to 3)
- ANALYZE STAGE: Advanced data exploration (concepts from Course 3)
- CONSTRUCT STAGE: Models building and evaluation (concepts from Courses 4, 5, and 6)
- EXECUTE STAGE: Summary and results (summing everything up)

This would also come with an executive summary report and PACE Strategy Document. 

I will be building TWO models. A logistic regression model and a decision tree.

I will not be building a random forest or XGBoost model as they are much harder to explain than logistic regression and also more time consuming. Plus I have done BOTH in Course 6.

This is also the final project which sums everything I learned from the amazing advanced analytics certificate and give me an opportunity to demonstrate everything.
