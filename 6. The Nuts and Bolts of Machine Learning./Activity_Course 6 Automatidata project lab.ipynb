    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes I would recommend using the model, as the Big Four metrics are well in the acceptable range.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: My models were trying to predict generosity among taxi passengers based on fares paid. Unfortunately, I can't explain it in detail as random forest and XGBoost are not explanable. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: There would be new features that I could possibly engineer. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Trip distances (length with set boundaries), fare paid (dollars with set boundaries) and some more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
